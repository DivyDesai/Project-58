        <div class="line"></div>
        In freetime, it is one of my favourite hobbies. Whenever I get time, I spend it by reading books. I read novels, stories, comics,etc. I am 12 years old and in 7th standard. I know that reading books is a good activity. One can get knowledge, inspiration, enjoyment,etc. It keeps a person happy and busy. We can also speak some new words, which we get to know from books, in our daily life and improve are vocabulary. It can make us disciplined, punctual, loyal and a good person.
